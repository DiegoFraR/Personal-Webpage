  <h1>Diego Frausto Ramirez</h1>
  <h3>Aspiring Software Engineer</h3>
  <h5>Learning the world of Software Engineering</h5>

  <!--Why I chose Software Engineering -->
  <p>While in high school, I decided to try out an  intro to programming course. Little did I know that this little thing we call coding
  would turn into one of my passions. I began by writing simple one-off Java programs such as FizzBuzz and things similar to it. I enjoyed the unique challenge
    that coding provided. It allowed me to express my strong mathematical skills and creativity. While researching for undergraduate degrees to pursue, I noticed
    the software engineering degree that <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu">Kennesaw State University</a> offered and instantly knew this is what I wanted to study.
    I love working on big picture projects, and software engineering seemed to align perfectly.
  </p>

  <p>My current goals are to continue learning new things about the Software Engineering industry and finish my studies at <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu">Kennesaw State University</a>.
  My anticipated graduation date is May 2025, and I am excited to start working as a Software Engineer in the industry. In my free time, I enjoy developing side projects as these allow me to learn about new technologies
  that my university does not teach. I learn best through hands-on learning, and these side projects provide an outlet for me to learn and be creative.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whenever I am not at my computer, I enjoy spending time with my family, exercising, playing sports (soccer mainly), and learning about other things in the world. The latter
    tends to send me down a rabbit hole 99% of the time.
